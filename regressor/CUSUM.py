def cusum_batch(signals, min_seg_len=10):
    """
    Apply the CUSUM approach to a batch of 2-channel signals for change-point detection
    and amplitude estimation.

    For each signal, the algorithm:
      1. Computes the overall mean for each channel.
      2. Computes the cumulative sum of deviations from the mean.
      3. Combines the two channelsâ€™ CUSUM statistics via the Euclidean norm.
      4. Searches for the candidate index (restricted by min_seg_len) at which the combined
         CUSUM statistic is maximized. This index is chosen as the jump index.
      5. Estimates the amplitudes as the means of the two segments (before and after the jump).

    Parameters:
        signals (np.ndarray): Array of shape (batch, 2, L) containing the signals.
        min_seg_len (int): Minimum allowed number of samples per segment. Default is 10.

    Returns:
        start_amplitudes (np.ndarray): Estimated start amplitudes, shape (batch, 2).
        stop_amplitudes (np.ndarray): Estimated stop amplitudes, shape (batch, 2).
        jump_indices (np.ndarray): Estimated jump indices, shape (batch,).
